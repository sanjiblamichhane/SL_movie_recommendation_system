\section{Problems To Be Solved}
In order to automate the process, we will need to implement the following technologies into our Omni-GPR robot: a path-finding algorithm running that interfaces between the sensor and micro controller. In the initial stages,a robotic chasis will be built, upon which we will buid Omni-directional robot.
